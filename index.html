        <h3> Our Mission </h3>
    <p> Universe is a vast phenomena. We have trivial knowledge about inner space and outer space. Aeronautics, Space Science,
         Astronomy have its own impact on people. Day by day technology is spreading its wings to the unknown and infinity. 
        So our mission is to make people explore briefly.</p>

    <div class="info"> <h3> What people know </h3> 
        <p> People are very curious about space but We have trivial knowledge about inner space and outer space. Space Science,
            Astronomy have its own impact on people. Day by day technology is spreading its wings to the unknown and infinity. 
           So our mission is to quench people's thirst  </p> </div> 
<div class="info"> <h3> Vs. Exploration</h3>
    <p> Some unknowns include the nature of dark matter and dark energy,the exact origin and fate of the universe, the possibility 
        of extraterrestrial life. Additionally, understanding the 
         of black holes and the true extent of the multiverse are ongoing research. </p> </div>
